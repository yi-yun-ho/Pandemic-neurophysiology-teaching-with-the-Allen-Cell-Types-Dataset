    "# Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise as a final project paper is to introduce you to the electrical excitability properties of mammalian brain neurons, including those of humans. We will use the Allen Brain Institute data base of neuronal patch clamp recordings as a resource to explore mammalian neuronal excitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goals for the final group paper are for you to more deeply understand the parameters of neuronal activity, introduce a practice of working with computer code for some of you, and for your group to demonstrate your expertise in writing a scientific paper. Next week we will give you more specific details of what we expect in your final group paper. For now we lay out the assignment directions for you to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Groups with 2 lab partners will pick 2 single neurons and those with 3 lab partners will pick 3 single neurons of different types, subtypes or human disease to characterize neuronal properties in Parts II, II and III. For part IV: 2 person groups will pick 2 different cell populations and groups of 3 lab partners will pick 3 different cell populations to compare. In part IV, pick, for example, human cells with epilepsy vs tumors; mouse neurons from different brain regions; aspiny vs spiny neurons; neurons of different types like glutamatergic neurons vs GABAergic neurons, cholinergic neurons vs GABAergic neurons, parvalbumin-, somatostatin- vs vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neurons. You can look over the cell types [here](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/data) and suggest your own comparisons. Use populations with a reasonable number of cells.  Contact us and we'll help guide you in your choices. \n",
